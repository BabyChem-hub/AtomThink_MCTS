Problem: State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.
Pred: The graph shows a straight line that divides the coordinate plane into two regions. The line appears to be the boundary of the shaded region, which is below the line and extends indefinitely in both directions along the x-axis.

The equation of the line can be determined by observing its slope and y-intercept. The line passes through the origin (0,0) and has a negative slope, indicating it is decreasing as we move from left to right. The exact equation of the line is not provided, but we can infer that the line is \(y = -x\).

Since the shaded region is below this line, the inequality that describes this region is:

\[ y \leq -x \]

This means all points \((x, y)\) in the shaded area satisfy the inequality \( y \leq -x \).
GT: $y \geq-2 x-6$

Problem: 
Pred: To determine the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane, we need to analyze the graph:

1. **Identify the Line**: The line in the graph is a straight line passing through the origin (0,0) with a slope of 1. This means the equation of the line is \( y = x \).

2. **Determine the Region**: The shaded region is below the line \( y = x \). This means all points in the shaded region satisfy the inequality \( y < x \).

Therefore, the inequality that describes the region is:

\[
y < x
\]

Problem: Piecewise functions $f$ and $g$ can model the heights (in meters) of two airplanes. $g$ is purple and goes through (0,10000), (40,9000), (80,9000), (100,11000), (130,11000), and $f$ is blue and goes through (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). $t$ is the number of minutes that have passed since noon at a local airport. Which statements represent the meaning of the intersection points of the graphs?
Choices:
A.They mean that one airplane was initially higher than the other airplane.
B.They mean that the airplanes reached the same height when they were both at 10,000 meters.
C.They give the solutions to the equation $f(t)=0$.
D.They give the solutions to the equation $f(t)=g(t)$.
